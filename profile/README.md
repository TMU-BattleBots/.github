> *Engineering the future of combat robotics in Canada*

</div>

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **BattleBots TMU**! We are Toronto Metropolitan University's premier combat robotics team dedicated to designing, building, and competing with battle robots across North America.

<div align="center">

## 🔥 Our Mission

</div>

BattleBots TMU exists to:
- Foster engineering excellence through hands-on robotics experience
- Build a thriving combat robotics community in Canada
- Provide students with real-world design and fabrication skills
- Compete at the highest levels of combat robotics competitions

<div align="center">

## 🚀 Our Approach

</div>

We believe in learning by doing. New members start building immediately:

- **1lb (Antweight) & 3lb (Beetleweight)** robots for newcomers to gain immediate hands-on experience
- **30lb (Featherweight)** robots for our experienced team members
- Future plans include expanding to **250lb robots** for major international competitions

This tiered approach ensures everyone can contribute meaningfully while developing their skills progressively.
