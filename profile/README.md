> *Engineering the future of combat robotics in Canada*

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **BattleBots TMU**! We are Toronto Metropolitan University's premier combat robotics team dedicated to designing, building, and competing with battle robots across North America.

## 🔥 Our Mission

BattleBots TMU exists to:

- Foster engineering excellence through hands-on robotics experience
- Build a thriving combat robotics community in Canada
- Provide students with real-world design and fabrication skills
- Compete at the highest levels of combat robotics competitions

## 🚀 Our Approach

We believe in learning by doing. New members start building immediately:

- **1lb (Antweight) & 3lb (Beetleweight)** robots for newcomers to gain immediate hands-on experience
- **30lb (Featherweight)** robots for our experienced team members
- Future plans include expanding to **250lb robots** for major international competitions

This tiered approach ensures everyone can contribute meaningfully while developing their skills progressively.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills

Our team works with cutting-edge technologies across multiple disciplines:

- **Mechanical Design:** SolidWorks, Fusion 360, FEA simulation
- **Materials:** Titanium, hardened steel, carbon fiber composites
- **Manufacturing:** CNC machining, 3D printing, waterjet cutting
- **Electronics:** Custom PCB design, brushless motor control, power management
- **Software:** Robot control systems, telemetry, autonomous features

## 🏆 Competitions

We actively participate in competitions including:

- **Robogames**
- **ComBots Cup**
- **Robot Battles**
- And we're working to establish more competitions within Canada!
